Obsidian recently released a new core plugin called "canvas" which allows for the user to place Notes, Headers, and Media anywhere in a basically infinite, easily  location. Though a great update and addition I am sure will ignite numerous new plugins for the new mode, this plugin adds numerous canvas and folder commands and utilities to better take advantage of the canvas. 

Made with ü§ç by Conner Ohnesorge 

## Commands 
### Localize Canvas Command
Localize all files embededed the directory that the canvas you are presently viewing into the folder which contains the aformentioned active canvas. 
### Localize Canvas to Folder Command
Make sure that all files present in the canvas are inside of a housing folder. 
### Insert Canvas Elements from Vault into the active canvas
Insert the elements present in a canvas within your vault and insert the canvas into your active canvas. 

### Link Group to Folder Using Modal 
WIll rename the selected group with syntax to allow for the organization of files into folders within the core plugin of canvas. 

### Convert Canvas To Folder and move Contents to it 

### Convert Canvas to Folder and copy Contents to it 


# Usage 
While this plugin adds numerous commands and utilities, they all revolve around operations applied to the currently active canvas in your interface. So, if you encounter problems with commands not appearing, make sure that you are currently editing a canvas file in canvas view.
